# Contributing

Iron is still a small project. I have started this project with the bare minimum needed
for my immediate work. I will add both more as I need.  If you find this project useful
but missing pieces, please contribute. I am very happy to receive PRs filling in
everything that I'm missing. Even small contributions are valuable and welcome.

To help keep things organized, it would be good to open an issue and get my feedback
before you create a PR. But, often, this is overkill. Use your own judgement and
common-sense. :-)

All the usual GitHub and open-source guidelines apply. I'll elaborate further in
this document someday (or submit a PR for this!) but you won't go far wrong if you
follow common rules like those listed in
<https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-guidelines> or
